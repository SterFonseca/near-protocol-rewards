## What is Protocol Rewards?

Protocol Rewards is a developer-first funding solution for the NEAR ecosystem. We're solving a critical challenge in Web3: how to transform traditional one-time grants into sustainable, ongoing capital for developers - where funding automatically grows with their impact and contribution to NEAR.

### The Problem

- Traditional funding models (grants, VCs) require extensive time spent on proposals and pitches
- Developers want to focus on building, not fundraising
- Project impact is often measured subjectively
- Funding is typically front-loaded rather than tied to ongoing development

### Our Solution

Protocol Rewards provides:

- Automated tracking of development metrics and project impact
- Merit-based rewards tied directly to contributions
- Transparent, objective criteria for funding
- Sustainable, ongoing rewards that scale with project growth

By automating the entire process from tracking to distribution, we enable developers to focus on what they do best - building innovative solutions on NEAR.

## Get Started in 30 Seconds

1. Open terminal in your repository
2. Run this command:

```bash
npx near-protocol-rewards init
```

3. Push to main branch

That's it! ðŸŽ‰ Your metrics will show up at [Protocol Rewards Dashboard](https://protocol-rewards-dashboard.vercel.app/)

## How It Works

![Architecture](public/assets/architecture.png)

We automatically track:

- **Commits**: How often you code
- **Pull Requests**: How you integrate changes
- **Reviews**: How you help others
- **Issues**: How you manage tasks

Everything runs through GitHub Actions:

- No setup needed
- Uses GitHub's built-in security
- Updates every 12 hours and on push

## Common Questions

### When do metrics update?

- Every push to main branch
- Every 12 hours automatically
- Check Actions tab for status

### Do I need any tokens?

No! We use GitHub's built-in security.

### Not seeing your metrics?

1. Push something to main branch
2. Wait ~2 minutes for Action to run
3. Check Actions tab for status
4. See our [Troubleshooting Guide](docs/troubleshooting.md)
